  As the flagship large language model (LLM) product of OpenAI,
  ChatGPT has gained global attention for its remarkable ability to
  handle complex natural language understanding and generation
  tasks. Inspired by the success of the mobile app ecosystems, OpenAI
  enables third-party developers to create ChatGPT plugins to fur-
  ther expand ChatGPT’s capabilities. These plugins are distributed
  through the OpenAI’s plugin store and are easily accessible to users.
  With ChatGPT as the powerful backbone, this app ecosystem has
  illustrated great business potential by offering users personalized
  services in a conversational manner. Nonetheless, this ecosystem is
  still in its nascent stage and undergoing dynamic evolution. Many
  crucial aspects regarding app development, deployment, and secu-
  rity have yet to be thoroughly studied in the research community,
  potentially hindering a wider adoption by both developers and
  users. In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive study of the
  ChatGPT app ecosystem, aiming to unveil its landscape to our
  research community. Our study focuses on the distribution and
  deployment models in the integration of LLMs and third-party
  apps, and assesses their security and privacy implications. We in-
  vestigate the runtime execution mechanism of ChatGPT apps and
  accordingly propose a three-layer security assessment model from
  the perspectives of users, app developers, and store operators. Our
  evaluation of all 1,038 plugins available in the store reveals their
  uneven distribution of functionality, underscoring prevelent and
  emerging topics. Our security assessment also reveals a concerning
  status quo of security and privacy in the ChatGPT app ecosystem.
  We find that the authentication and user data protection for third-
  party app APIs integrated within LLMs contain severe flaws. For
  example, 173 plugins have broken access control vulnerabilities,
  368 plugins are subject to leaking manifest files, and 271 plugins
  provide inaccessible legal document links. Our study for the first
  time highlights the immaturity of the ChatGPT app ecosystem. Our
  findings should especially raise an alert to OpenAI and third-party
  developers to collaboratively maintain the security and privacy
  compliance of this emerging ecosystem.
