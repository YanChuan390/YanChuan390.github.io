#   We propose an end-to-end approach to automatically detecting excessive permissions among add-ons. It advocates purpose limitation that the requested permissions of the add-on should be for its specific functionality and in compliance with the actual needs in fulfilling the functionality. Our approach utilizes a hybrid analysis to detect excessive permissions, including analysis of the add-onâ€™s runtime behavior and source code, and state-of-the-art language processing techniques for textual artifact interpretation. This approach can serve the users, developers and store operators as an efficient and practical detection mechanism for excessive permissions.
