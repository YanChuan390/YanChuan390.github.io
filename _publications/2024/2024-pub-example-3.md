abstract: >-
  Virtual personal assistants (VPA) services encompass a large number of third-party applications (or apps) to enrich their functionalities. These apps have been well examined to scrutinize their data collection behaviors against their declared privacy policies. Nonetheless, it is often overlooked that most users tend to ignore privacy policies at the installation time. Dishonest developers thus can exploit this situation by embedding excessive declarations to cover their data collection behaviors during compliance auditing.
