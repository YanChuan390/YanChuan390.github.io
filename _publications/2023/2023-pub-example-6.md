  We conduct the first comprehensive study of the
  ChatGPT app ecosystem, aiming to unveil its landscape to our
  research community. Our study focuses on the distribution and
  deployment models in the integration of LLMs and third-party
  apps, and assesses their security and privacy implications. We in-
  vestigate the runtime execution mechanism of ChatGPT apps and
  accordingly propose a three-layer security assessment model from
  the perspectives of users, app developers, and store operators.
