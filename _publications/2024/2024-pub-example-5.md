#    We conduct the first systematic study on the consistency between the operational behaviors of the OS at runtime and the officially disclosed DPCs. We propose DopCheck, an automatic DPC-driven testing framework equipped with a large language model (LLM) pipeline. It features a serial of analysis to extract the ontology from the privacy change documents written in natural language, and then harnesses the few-shot capability of LLMs to construct test cases for the detection of DPC-compliance issues in OS implementations.
