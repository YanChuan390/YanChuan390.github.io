In the digital era, business collaboration platforms have become pivotal in facilitating seamless remote work and virtual team interactions. These platforms, typified by Google Workspace, offer an integrated suite of tools~(such as Google Docs, Slides, and Calendar) that significantly enhance business operations. They often extend their functionality through the integration of third-party applications, known as “add-ons”. Google Workspace exemplifies this trend, blending traditional business solutions with advanced, add-on-driven capabilities.
